<p>Tim Felten is the editor and engineer for A Way with Words, which means he handles the board during studio sessions and prepares the episodes for distribution. He’s also responsible for picking the great musical interludes you hear during the show. Outside of the show, he’s a composer and musician who plays organ and piano for bands such as The Fire Eaters, Pocket, and The Black Sands. Tim graduated from San Diego State University with a BA in music and earned his public radio wings at KPBS in San Diego, where he still works on occasion handling audio for KPBS-TV. Tim also enjoys camping, surfing, and micro-brews, especially when all three are mixed. He lives in San Diego with his wife and cat.</p>
